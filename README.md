Researching cheating/anti-cheating as a hobby. I'm using my knowledge to provide minimal   
effort projects for cheaters/anti-cheats, they can freely use them as learning/pen-test material.  
I dont pick sides, anti-cheating/cheating both requires creativity. both are cool up to certain point.  
VAC/EAC/Vanguard are good examples of cool anti-cheats.
