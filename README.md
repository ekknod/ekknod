Learning anti-cheats / cheats as a hobby. I'm using my knowledge to provide projects for anti-cheats / cheaters.  
Those can be freely used as learning / pen-test material. should reduce "reinvent the wheel" effect.

I'm working for both sides, Anti-Cheating/Cheating both requires the same creativity. both are cool up to certain point.  
VAC/EAC/Vanguard are good examples of cool anti-cheats, because they are really effective and not going to  
block you forever for bad decisions.
